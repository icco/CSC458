1. An event is a sequence of heads and tails
2. an equity has an initial price. m is global, and a multiplier 1 < m < 2 to use on a head and x by 1/m on a tail.
3. Develop a makeEquity function: double -> event -> double that excepts the values for p and a and returns a random variable. Random variable equals event -> double.
4. Develop a function expected : int -> randomVariable -> double that computes
