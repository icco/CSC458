Take 30 stocks for the last 20 years, compute all of the daily differences,
take the log of all of those, then the mean and std dev of those and plot them
together.
"beta" = does the stock behave like the market

a is the "market"
Beta(b) = covariance(p(a), p(b)) / var ( p(b) )

1) computer beta of 1 share of IBM vs 1 share of VFINX
   separately for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010

2) computer beta for a bond fund on the same time periods
